# Movie App with React

This is my first React project, a movie app sorted by rating and year. In my summary of React learning journey, I've divided the explanation into two parts: installation and usage.

## Introduction

If you're new to React, I recommend checking out my article on [Introduction of React](https://medium.com/@rladmsdk2068/introduction-of-react-6fb63326e732) for a brief overview of React and its key concepts.

## Installation

To get started with the movie app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory:  `cd movie-app`
3. Install dependencies:  `npm install`
4. Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the movie app:  `npm start`

This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser. You can then explore the movie lists sorted by rating and year.

For a detailed guide on creating the movie app with React, refer to my article [Create movie app with React](https://medium.com/@rladmsdk2068/create-movie-app-with-react-7ecc58a7956e).

Happy movie browsing!
